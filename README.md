# `Spectre.Console`

This is a fork of Spectre.Console, adapted to the needs of [Duets](https://github.com/sleepyfran/duets), mainly to have early merges of some features that we need for the game or some features that might not make sense upstream but are useful for us.

## Things merged/implemented so far that are not upstream

-   [PR #711](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/pull/711) with slight modifications, which adds support for aborting selection prompts.
-   [PR #1289](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/pull/1289), which adds support for searching in selection prompts.
-   [PR #1246](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console/pull/1246), which adds support for custom colors in each individual calendar event.
